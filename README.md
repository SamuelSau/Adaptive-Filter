# Adaptive-Filter

## Purpose

Implement an adaptive filter in real-time with the STM32446RE-Nucleo board using the STM32CubeIDE

## Features
* 180mHZ max clock speed for SYSCLCK using HSI RC (eventually may port to HSE for stability).
* Enabled USART2 using CubeIDE's serial terminal for COM5 port to debug printf and debugging statements.
